# WayLight Companion

Static single-page companion site. There is no build step or dependency tree; open the HTML directly in a browser.

WayLight Companion is a quiet personal console that gathers entry points for life, work, civic, creative, and systems practice. It offers a themed landing screen with an access lock, language/theme toggles, and panels that link out to your own tools, boards, and rituals.

## Viewing locally
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or serve the folder with a simple HTTP server).
2. Use the access code `WAYLIGHT` (case-insensitive) on the landing overlay to enter.
3. The theme and language toggles persist via `localStorage`, and other feature panels are available in the linked HTML files (e.g., `waylight.html`, `work.html`, `personal.html`).
